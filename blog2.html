    <p>In my professional career, I’ve learned that life’s journey often resembles a roadmap. Recently, as I delved into the course “Strategic Management and Accounting,” I found myself on a deeper exploration. What emerged was the realisation that each of us inherently possesses a strategic methodology—a way of navigating challenges and opportunities.</p>
    <h1>Bumps along the way</h1>
    <p>Fifteen years ago, my roadmap wouldn’t have led me here without the experiences that had shaped it. Completing my education had always been a goal of mine, but life threw some unexpected curveballs. In 2015, my priorities shifted when there was a decline in mine and my family’s health and wellbeing, as a result throughout this time education took a backseat.</p>
    <h1>A defining conversation</h1>
    <p>In 2017, during a conversation with a senior project manager, I was asked a simple question: “What do you like to do?” My response—project management and problem-solving—led to an eye-opening revelation. The projects I’d worked on, from my initial role as a project assistant to project coordinator, were all part of my journey to project management.</p>
    <h1>Taking the first step</h1>
    <p>Realising the importance of my road ahead, I decided to pursue the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification from the Project Management Institute. The path wasn’t easy, but I successfully completed the required courses and passed the examination. Yet, I knew there was more to achieve. </p>
    <h1>No excuses, only opportunities</h1>
    <p>The pandemic brought clarity. Online education channels were abundant, and excuses vanished. I explored Coursera and stumbled upon the BSc Business Administration programme at the University of London. Despite being almost 50 years old, I asked myself: Was I ready? Would this education enhance my career path? Why was I doing this?</p>
    <h1>I had a 'seizing the moment' moment</h1>
    <p>I signed up, and from that moment, there was no looking back. My parents, who hailed from humble beginnings on a small Philippine Island, had moved to the United States for our sake. They wanted us to seize opportunities. Starting work right after high school, I found myself in the corporate world, collaborating with project and programme managers. Problem-solving became my passion.</p>
